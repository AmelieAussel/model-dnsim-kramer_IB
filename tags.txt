Here is the format I use for defining tags

There are several classes  of tags. These are defined by their prefix, for example:

Figs - versions of model associated with a particular figures folder in model-dnsim-kramer_IB_Figs
FigSub - versions of model associated with a particualr subfolder in model-dnsim-kramer_IB_Figs. For
	example, d180321_t155456__hcurrent6_default/kr_DeltaFig1a11_hcurrent6/d180325_t191755__kr_DeltaFig1a11_hcurrent6
Model - versions of model not associated with any thing in particular, but nonetheless measuring
	major milestones in model development. Usually, models will have various subtags associated
	with them. For example,
		Model_v3.0 - describes the general chronological progression of my models
		Model_hrw_v1.0 - describes version of a specific model configuration (in this case, the h-current rebound working model)

Pres - versions of code associated with a particular presentation (in GDrive/Delta folder)

Generally, I will have it set up so that the description of a particular tag class is included in the
first (earliest) tag associated with that class. Some tags don't begin at 1.0 to allow earlier definitions of
the model.

For example, git show hrw_v1.0 will include a description of the general class of hrw tags.
