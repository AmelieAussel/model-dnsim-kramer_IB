Specs.mat is a mat file containing spec structs corresponding to different
tags in the git repo and also to different versions of kramer.m in the
figure folders.

For use with dsSpecDiff to identify differences between models.

They are created by using utility_adjust_params.m to force most of the
non-essential parameters to be the same, to reduce the amount of spam in
dsSpecDiff. See utility_adjust_params.m

The protocol to create one of these specs snapshots:
+ Put breakpoints before include_kramer_IB_populations 
is called and also before the dsSimulate call.
+ Run kramer_IB.m.
+ When reach the first breakpoint (before populations are defined) run
utility_adjust_params.m. This will ensure the adjusted params are used
in creating the populations and synapses.
+ Continue running code
+ When reach second breakpoint, save the specs file and exit. 
+ Recommended naming convention is: specs_<tag_name> OR specs_<folder_name>
